Project Title

Menu-Based Currency Converter Using C

Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple menu-driven currency converter using the C programming language. The program allows the user to convert currency between:

INR ↔ USD

USD ↔ EUR

INR ↔ EUR

This project helps beginners understand:

Conditional statements (if-else)

Loops (while)

User input using scanf

Basic arithmetic operations

How to Compile and Run the Program

Step 1: Compile the program

Using GCC compiler:

gcc currency_converter.c -o converter

Step 2: Run the program

./converter

(For Windows users: converter.exe)

Sample Output (Optional)

===== CURRENCY CONVERTER =====

1. INR -> USD

2. USD -> INR

3. USD -> EUR

4. EUR -> USD

5. INR -> EUR

6. EUR -> INR

7. Exit

Choose: 1

Enter amount: 100

100.00 INR = 1.20 USD

Important Notes & Assumptions

Conversion rates are fixed (hard-coded) and may not reflect real-time market values.

The program runs in an infinite loop until the user selects option 7 (Exit).

Input should always be a valid number; incorrect input may cause unexpected behavior.

This is a basic beginner-level project, not intended for real financial use.

Internet is not used for live exchange rates.

Features :

Easy menu-based interface

Supports 6 different currency conversions

Continuous operation until exit

Clean and simple structure
